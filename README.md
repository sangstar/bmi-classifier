# BMI Calculator

I spent part of an evening setting this up. Took some data from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/bmidataset) dataset and made a model that predicts someone's BMI classification using the terms 'Extremely weak', 'Weak', 'Normal', 'Overweight', 'Obese', 'Extremely obese', based on their height (cm), weight (kg) and gender. 

I might spend some more time on this, since this was pretty hastily done. I could try and get some more data to train my classifier on, or experiment with other models to see if any outperform Random Forest.
